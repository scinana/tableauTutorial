# data
- The data in the data folder ([**movie_subset_netflix.csv**](https://github.com/scinana/tableauTutorial/blob/main/data/movie_subset_netflix.csv)) is a subset of the original *movie_dataset.csv* file from the ["Movie Dataset: Budgets, Genres, Insights"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/movies-dataset) dataset from Kaggle.
- A subset was chosen so learners can work with lightweight files and they can focus on learning Tableau concepts (rather than cleaning up and preparing data).
- A second file ([**genres_netflix_films.xslx**](https://github.com/scinana/tableauTutorial/blob/main/data/genres_netflix_films.xlsx)) has been added to the data folder, containing the list of genres for the Netflix films.
------------------------
- Note: this data is shared for educational purposes only and no relationship nor representation of Netflix is intended.
- I am not the creator of the Kaggle dataset. I simply used it to create a data subset.
